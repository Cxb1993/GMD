%%xx General points
%%xx 0 Some suggestions in the text itself are shown with "xx" -- so if you just search for "xx" you will find them --> Done
%%xx 1 Make sure tenses match throughout
%%xx 2 use \citet for citations in-line (text), e.g., "\citet{monaghanpaper} found that SPH is great...", not "Monaghan \citep{monaghanpaper} found that SPH is great..." -->Done
%%xx 3 Need a section on the atmospheric structure, and how atmosphere can be incorporated into model, especially NWP or radiosondes
%%xx 4 You often seem to forget to put a space between paragraphs.  LaTeX of course does not recognize a <return> as a paragraph delimiter, nor is it proper to end a normal paragraph with \\ or % -->Done
%%xx 5 You are inconsistent with capitalization in section headings.  Either always use an initial capital letter, or only use an initial capital letter on the first word, proper names or acronyms
%%xx 6 Figures are of generally poor quality -- use PDF and reproduce at larger scale.  
%%xx 7 Difficult to understand what figure of Pinatubo plume is supposed to be telling us about the model
